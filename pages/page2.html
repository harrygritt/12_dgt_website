           <p>
               Bobby Fischer was a chess grandmaster and is regarded as one of the greats in Chess. Born in Chicago,
               Illinois, US on March 9, 1943, the chess legend has had an interesting career. He reached a peak ELO rating
               of 2785 which is the widely used rating for chess that measures the relative strength and skill of chess players.
               Fischer held the title for World Champion between 1972-1975. Not only did Fischer contribute to the world of
               chess with his brilliant play, but he also published a book in 1969, <em>My 60 Memorable Games</em>, whilst
               also inventing <em>Fischer Random Chess</em>, also known as <em>Chess960</em>. This variant of chess entails the
               initial positions of pieces being randomised to one of 960 possible options.

           <p>
               Garry Kasparov is another chess grandmaster that can be debated to be the greatest of all time.
               Kasparov was born on 13 April, 1963 in Baku, Azerbaijan SSR, Soviet Union. He reached a peak
               ELO rating of 2851 in July 1999 and was a World Champion from 1985 to 2000. He has also been
               apart of movements that oppose the administration of Vladimir Putin which eventually led to
               Kasparov leaving Russia and living in New York with family. In 2014, the chess genius managed
               to gain Croatian citizenship and now resides in Podstrana near Split.

       <div class="body-text">
           <p>
               Magnus Carlsen is often regarded as the greatest chess player of all time. He was born in TÃ¸nsberg,
               Norway on the 30th of November, 1990 and is most notable for his ability to expertly sacrifice his
               pieces for a beautiful checkmate many moves on. This extraordinary talent earned him a peak ELO rating
               of 2882 (the highest in history) in May 2014. This chess maestro's family bounced around Europe when
               he was a child but that didn't stop him from showing incredible potential at an early age, being able
               to solve 500-piece puzzles at just 2 years old. He reigned as World Champion from 2013 to 2023 and is
               a chess grandmaster. He reached No. 1 in the FIDE world rankings at just 19, becoming the youngest person
               ever to accomplish the feat. To add to his accolades, he is also the record holder for the longest unbeaten
               streak at the elite level in classical chess.
