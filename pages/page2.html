            <p>Bobby Fischer was a chess grandmaster and is regarded as one of the greats in Chess. Born in Chicago, Illinois, US on March 9, 1943, the chess legend has had an interesting career. He reached a peak ELO rating of 2785 which is the widely used rating for chess that measures the relative strength and skill of chess players. Fischer held the title for World Champion between 1972-1975. Not only did Fischer contribute to the world of chess with his brilliant play, but he also published a book in 1969, <em>My 60 Memorable Games</em>, whilst also inventing <em>Fischer Random Chess</em>, also known as <em>Chess960</em>. This variant of chess entails the initial positions of peices being randomised to one of 960 possible options.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, Fischer passed away aged 64 on January 17, 2008. This came after his prolific career led him to play chess matches that were frowned upon by the US government given the political situation at the time (Cold Wr and embargo on  Yugoslavia). Evuantually, the US government revoked his passport adn Fischer managed to be granted Icelandic citizenship in 2005 where he lived untill his passing away.</p>

            <p>Magnus Carlsen is often regarded as the greatest chess player of all time. He was born in TÃ¸nsberg, Norway on the 30th of November, 1990 and is most notable for his ability to expertly sacrifice his pieces for a beautiful checkmate many moves on. This extraordinary talent earned him a peak ELO rating of 2882 (the highest in history) in May 2014. This chess maestro's family bounced around Europe when he was a child but that didn't stop him from showing incredible potential at an early age, being able to solve 500-piece puzzles at just 2 years old. He reigned as World Champion from 2013 to 2023 and is a chess grandmaster. He reached No. 1 in the FIDE world rankings at just 19, becoming the youngest person ever to accomplish the feat. To add to his accolades, he is also the record holder for the longest unbeaten streak at the elite level in classical chess.</p>
