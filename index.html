            <p>Chess is widely considered a ruthlessly, intellectually demanding board game. This stimulating game originates from India in the 6th Century C.E (aka the 500's C.E), going by the name <em>Chaturanga</em>. Eventually, the board game made its way across Asia, the Middle East, and then to Europe. In Europe  we get the name <em>Chess</em> from a french word, <em>Esch√©s</em>. However, Chess is not loyal or belonging to any one country, it is spectacular game for the World's enjoyment and consumption.</p>
            <p>Here you will find some of the greatest players to ever grace the game, the movement/rules of the peices, and some of the different types of checkmate</p>
