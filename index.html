                Chess is widely considered a ruthlessly, intellectually demanding board game. This stimulating game originates from India in the 
                6th Century C.E (aka the 500's C.E), going by the name <em>Chaturanga</em>. Eventually, the board game made its way across Asia, 
                the Middle East, and then to Europe. In Europe  we get the name <em>Chess</em> from a french word, <em>Esch√©s</em>. However, 
                Chess is not loyal or belonging to any one country, it is spectacular game for the World's enjoyment and consumption.
